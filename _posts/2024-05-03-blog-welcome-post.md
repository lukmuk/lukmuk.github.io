This is my first blog post! I try to keep adding new ones with interesting topics, mostly revolving around electron microscopy, data processing, or other topics that might come to my mind. 

I will also use it to display and explain my shared scripts and tools on Github. I try to contribute useful tools for other researchers. ðŸ˜Š

For this first post, I will add one of my favorite (filtered) HAADF-STEM images of a GdBa\\(_2\\)Cu\\(_3\\)O\\(_{7-\\delta}\\) (GdBCO) thin film acquired on a non-probe-corrected TEM.

Can you spot all precipitates? ðŸ‘»
