My name is **Lukas GrÃ¼newald** and I am a researcher specializing in **electron microscopy**, where I study materials at the micrometer to nanometer scale. I am affiliated with the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)](https://www.kit.edu/english/index.php).

## Research

I specialize in analytical electron microscopy (SEM/TEM/FIB) for materials science research and methodology development. Here, I aim to maximize microscope performance and data quality and combine it with state-of-the-art data processing to gain new insights to optimize material performance.  
Within my research, I am enthusiastic about open science and the sharing of workflows, code, and raw data to help other researchers and for scientific reproducibility. 

See my work at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=MTCt99kAAAAJ).

## News

* December 2024 - We contributed in-depth EBSD and TEM analyses for our new paper on 3D-printed ZnO crystals with rotating crystal lattices. The video shows the local background-corrected EBSD patterns and Hough-indexed bands using [kikuchipy](https://kikuchipy.org/en/stable/). The orientation gradually changes and follow the 90Â°-change in printing direction.
I presented this work as a poster at the [Microscopy & Microanalysis](https://doi.org/10.1093/mam/ozae044.616) Conference in Cleveland in August 2024.

* November 2024 - A new [blog post](https://lukmuk.github.io//posts/2024/11/blog-index-dp-recipro-inkscape/) about diffraction-pattern indexing with ReciPro and subsequent polishing of the indexed result with inkscape - all in nice vector graphics.

* July 2024 - Our new article in [ACS Nanoletters](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.nanolett.4c02182) investigates the microstructure of epitaxial GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dots by combining AFM and TEM analyses. This work was part of my postdoc stay at [EMAT](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/emat/) (Antwerp).

* May 2024 - Working with EBSD and Bruker systems? Have a look at my [blog post](https://lukmuk.github.io//posts/2024/05/blog-ebsd-bcf/) about data conversion from bcf to hdf5 for data processing with open-source tools such as [kikuchipy](https://kikuchipy.org/en/stable/).

* February 2024 - Check out the articles by [phys.org](https://phys.org/news/2024-02-real-microscopic-imaging-plasma-treatment.html) and [Nanowerk](https://www.nanowerk.com/nanotechnology-news3/newsid=64748.php) for our recent work about the application of plasma in an SEM published in [Advanced Materials Technologies](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/admt.202301632). This work was part of my postdoc stay at [EMAT](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/emat/) (Antwerp).

* December 2023 - Our [front cover](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2023/ma/d3ma90102e) was chosen for the *Materials Advances* journal for our [article](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2023/ma/d3ma00447c) *Analytical electron microscopy study of the composition of BaHfO\\(_3\\) nanoparticles in REBCO films: the influence of rare-earth ionic radii and REBCO composition*.  
  I dove into [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) to generate the cover art.
