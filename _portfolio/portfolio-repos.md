This is a continuously updated list of my repositories with a short description.

#### [EM ScaleBarTools](https://github.com/lukmuk/em-scalebartools)

* Fiji macro toolset to quickly add a scale bar to an image
* The scale bar size is scaled relative to the image dimensions, independent of the image's pixel dimensions
* Options to create a more a visually pleasing scale bar (e.g., automatic re-scaling of the pixel size)

#### [Inkscape: Scientific Figure Template](https://github.com/lukmuk/inkscape-scientific-figure-template)

* Inkscape is a powerful vector-graphics editor to layout and create scientific figures
* This template contains subfigure labels, arrow annotations, predefined colors for the color picker, and more!

#### [Manuca](https://github.com/lukmuk/manuca) (Mean Atomic Number Calculator)

* Python script to calculate various physical properties of compounds (such as the effective atomic number, compositions in at& and wt%)
* My first test of running a BinderHub project for quick access and as a demo
* Can be used to create complicated mixtures of compounds
* Especially useful in combination with Monte Carlo simulations and other material modelling or just to check EDXS/EELS composition results :-)

#### [EM File Readers](https://github.com/lukmuk/em-file-readers)

* List of electron microscopy vendor formats and how to open them with FOSS tools
* I update the list whenever I work with new instrumentation/new file formats

#### Jupyter Notebook: [Particle Size Distribtution](https://github.com/lukmuk/particle-size-distribution)

* Jupyter notebook for fitting a log-normal (or other) particle size distribution to a measured size metric 
* Will calculate and propagate fitting errors

#### Jupyter Notebook: [Interactive EDS-EELS Comparison](https://github.com/lukmuk/jl-eds-eels)

* A short notebook to explore the differences in energy resolution between EDS and EELS
* A first test of using JupyterLite with HyperSpy/eXSpy

#### Jupyter Notebook: [EDS Processing](https://github.com/lukmuk/eds-processing-notebooks)

* Jupyter notebook for advanced data processing of S(T)EM-EDS datasets
* Powered by HyperSpy/eXSpy
* Data filtering, cropping, binning, etc.
* Machine learning: PCA/ICA/NMF/...
* X-ray peak intensity extraction by simple integration or peak fitting

#### Jupyter Notebook: [Image Denoising with Deep Learning](https://github.com/lukmuk/r_em_workflows)

* Methods to (batch) denoise electron microscopy images using the deep-learning model by Lobato, Friedrich and Van Aert
* Reading of TIFFs or other electron-microscopy image formats

#### [EM Stuff](https://github.com/lukmuk/em-stuff)

* My first repository!
* Collection of code snippets and tools related to electron microscopy
