This is a list of my used techniques and skills.

### Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)

* Experience with FEI/TFS/Philips instruments
* BF- and (WB)DF-TEM (two-beam condition)
* SAED
* (Cs-corrected) HRTEM (minimum contrast, Scherzer defocus, NCSI)
* (Cs-corrected) HRSTEM (HAADF, ADF, ABF, BF)
* µP-STEM and nanobeam diffraction (NBED)
* STEM-EDS
* STEM-EELS (mostly core-loss)

Used instruments:  
FEI Titan³ 80-300 (image-corrected and double-corrected), FEI Tecnai Osiris, Philips CM200 FEG SuperTwin, FEI Tecnai G2, Zeiss 912 (barely, but with image plates :-)).  

### Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)

* Experience with FEI/TFS instruments
* Basic and high-resolution SE and BSE imaging (field-free/immersion modes)
* Conventional (> 5 keV) and low-energy (< 5 keV) SEM-EDS
* SEM-EBSD (Bruker system)
* STEM-in-SEM (with EDS and TKD)
* Beam-deceleration SEM
* (In-situ) ESEM (low pressure and water vapor) for materials science (reduce charging, sample-water reactions, plasma generation)

Used instruments:
FEI Strata 400S, FEI Quanta 650 & Quanta 250 ESEM, FEI Nova 200, TFS Helios G4 FX & Helios 650 NanoLab, Zeiss/LEO Gemini 1530 (barely)

### Focused ion beam (FIB)

* Experience with FEI/TFS instruments (Ga-ion source)
* Ion imaging (channeling)
* Cross-section preparation & SEM imaging
* FIB-SEM tomography
* TEM-sample preparation (cross-section & plan-view geometries)

Used instruments:
FEI Strata 400S, TFS Helios G4 FX & Helios 650 NanoLab, FEI Nova 200

### Other Techniques

* Basic experience in clean-room environment (spin coater, mask writer, mask aligner, PVD metal deposition, RIE, wet etching, plasma cleaning)
