My name is **Lukas GrÃ¼newald** and I am a researcher specializing in **electron microscopy**, where I study materials at the micrometer to nanometer scale. I am affiliated with the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)](https://www.kit.edu/english/index.php).

## Research

I specialize in analytical electron microscopy (SEM/TEM/FIB) for materials science research and methodology development. Here, I aim to maximize microscope performance and data quality and combine it with state-of-the-art data processing to gain new insights to optimize material performance.  
Within my research, I am enthusiastic about open science and the sharing of workflows, code, and raw data to help other researchers and for scientific reproducibility.

## News

* February 2024 - Check out the articles by [phys.org](https://phys.org/news/2024-02-real-microscopic-imaging-plasma-treatment.html) and [Nanowerk](https://www.nanowerk.com/nanotechnology-news3/newsid=64748.php) for our recent work about the application of plasma in an SEM published in [Advanced Materials Technologies](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/admt.202301632).

* December 2023 - Our [front cover](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2023/ma/d3ma90102e) was chosen for the *Materials Advances* journal for our [article]((https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2023/ma/d3ma00447c) *Analytical electron microscopy study of the composition of BaHfO\\(_3\\) nanoparticles in REBCO films: the influence of rare-earth ionic radii and REBCO composition*.  
  I dove into [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) to generate the cover art.
